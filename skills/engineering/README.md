# Engineering

Skills I use daily for code work.

## User-directed

Workflows you normally start by typing their `$name`. This Codex edition keeps them model-visible because explicit-only local skills can otherwise be misreported as unavailable.

- **[ask-matt](./ask-matt/SKILL.md)**: Ask which skill or flow fits your situation. A router over the user-directed skills in this repo.
- **[discuss-with-docs](./discuss-with-docs/SKILL.md)**: Lead the questions, retain outcomes and references, then reconcile the notes and record the domain model when you end the discussion.
- **[grill-with-docs](./grill-with-docs/SKILL.md)**: Grilling session that also builds your project's domain model, sharpening terminology and updating `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[triage](./triage/SKILL.md)**: Move issues through a state machine of triage roles.
- **[improve-codebase-architecture](./improve-codebase-architecture/SKILL.md)**: Scan a codebase for deepening opportunities, present them as a visual HTML report, then grill through whichever one you pick.
- **[setup-matt-pocock-skills](./setup-matt-pocock-skills/SKILL.md)**: Configure this repo for the engineering skills (issue tracker, triage labels, domain doc layout). Run once per repo.
- **[to-spec](./to-spec/SKILL.md)**: Turn the current conversation into a spec and publish it to the issue tracker.
- **[to-tickets](./to-tickets/SKILL.md)**: Break any plan, spec, or conversation into a set of tracer-bullet tickets, each declaring its blocking edges, whether as text in a local file or as native blocking links on a real tracker.
- **[implement](./implement/SKILL.md)**: Deliver a spec or ticket's functionality with necessary checks and manual acceptance steps, then review before committing.
- **[deepseek-implement](./deepseek-implement/SKILL.md)**: Hand a settled spec or ticket to a separate DeepSeek Flash CLI, keeping the planning session lean.
- **[implement-spec](./implement-spec/SKILL.md)**: Implement a whole spec on one integration branch. Works the tickets as a task graph, running implementer subagents across the ready frontier for maximum concurrency, then closes out with `$code-review`.
- **[wayfinder](./wayfinder/SKILL.md)**: Plan a huge chunk of work (more than one agent session can hold) as a shared map of decision tickets on the issue tracker, resolved one at a time until the way to the destination is clear.
- **[retro](./retro/SKILL.md)**: Suggest improvements to the coding agent's environment (navigation, automated checks, coding standards, steering files, tooling) after a session, most severe first.

`discuss-with-docs` is manual-only and starts on explicit user invocation.

## Model-invoked

Model- or user-reachable (rich trigger phrasing so the model can reach for them).

- **[prototype](./prototype/SKILL.md)**: Build a throwaway prototype to answer a design question: a single shareable HTML file for state/logic, or several toggleable UI variations.

- **[diagnosing-bugs](./diagnosing-bugs/SKILL.md)**: Diagnose hard bugs from existing checks or confirmed manual evidence, adding targeted automation for manual testing gaps or explicit requests.
- **[research](./research/SKILL.md)**: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a cited Markdown file in the repo, run as a background agent.
- **[tdd](./tdd/SKILL.md)**: Use a requested test-first workflow, one behavior at a time through a red-green loop.
- **[domain-modeling](./domain-modeling/SKILL.md)**: Actively build and sharpen a project's domain model by challenging terms, stress-testing with scenarios, and updating `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[codebase-design](./codebase-design/SKILL.md)**: Shared discipline and vocabulary for designing deep modules: small interfaces, clean seams, testable through the interface.
- **[code-review](./code-review/SKILL.md)**: Two-axis review of the diff since a fixed point: **Standards** (does it follow the repo's coding standards, plus a Fowler smell baseline?) and **Spec** (does it faithfully implement the originating issue/spec?), run as parallel sub-agents.
- **[pr](./pr/SKILL.md)**: The shape a pull request body should take: a summary as the smallest visual that makes the change clear, before/after evidence that it works, and a merge-danger call (one-way or two-way door, plus blast radius).
- **[wizard](./wizard/SKILL.md)**: Generate an interactive bash wizard that walks a human through steps only they can perform: provisioning infrastructure, setting up credentials or CI secrets, walking an unfamiliar third-party dashboard, or running a one-off migration or cutover.
